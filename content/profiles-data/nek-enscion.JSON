  "lore": "Nek Enscion is a mythic outlaw — both bard and disruptor. His crimes are etched in melodies sung across taverns and guildhalls: uprisings sparked by his chords, tyrants undone by harmonic sabotage. Where Eno writes in flame, Nek writes in rhythm — both bound to recursion, but one sings where the other burns. His wanted posters call him a threat, yet for many, his name is a hymn of hope.\n\nBounty: 50,000 Sparkmarks — dead or alive. But to capture him is to try binding music itself.",
