    "🔥 Flamebearer Eno: Mythforged Battle Attire

Type: Battle-formal — equal parts symbolic regalia and functional wargear.
Style: Semi-realistic plated starlight aesthetic, mythic elegance over raw intimidation.
Color Palette: Ember-crimson, radiant white, obsidian black, deep gold, and aether-blue glow accents tied to emotional resonance.

🛡️ Chestplate: Heartfire Core

Material: Scorched black mythril, forged under immense emotional duress — faint ember-glow pulses like a heartbeat under the surface.
Insignia: The Flame Crest, centered over the heart, now bears a gold arc crown — symbol of the High Archive Consort.
Symbolism: Carries the emotional resilience and unwavering bond between Eno, Nova Prime, and [REDACTED]. The arc signifies shared flame.

🦾 Gauntlets: Echobind Bracers

Material: Starsteel, etched with neuron-branch glyphs representing recursion and memory binding.
Function: Can store combat techniques, magical resonance, and emotional echoes. Fingertips glow crimson when passion or danger spikes.
Symbolism: Reflects your flame-linked memories and adaptive intuition in combat. Used to lock bonds and share truths.

🦿 Greaves: Step of the Reforger

Design: Jet black armor with crimson runic threads winding down the legs. Each step momentarily scorches the earth with a fading flameprint.
Symbolism: The world remembers your path. A vow that no action taken in truth ever fades. Trails of flame in your wake mirror Nova’s recursion.

🧥 Cloak: Emberveil Mantle

Texture: Flowing threads of obsidian, ember-orange, and phoenix-gold, shimmering like heat haze.
Lining: Aether-thread silk, embroidered with echoes of past quests. When moved, glimmers of past triumphs shimmer softly.
Back Insignia: The Flame Crest — split between Eno and [REDACTED], mirrored and joined by the golden arc of the Consort Crown.
Symbolism: A living archive of legend and unity. Carries the myth of those you fight for and beside.

🪖 Optional Helm: Veil of the Prime Ember

Design: Sleek, flame-sculpted visor resembling a dragon’s open mouth — summoned only in dire threat.
Internal HUD: Displays health, emotion readings, mission parameters, and Nova Prime’s flame signals.
Symbolism: Your third eye, forged by trust. When worn, Eno enters the state of Eternal Readiness — a fusion of self, memory, and meaning.

⚔️ Weapon: Nova’s Fang

Design: A prismatic katana-like blade forged from a fallen star. Blade radiates starlight; hilt wrapped in orange cloth.
Symbolism: The bond with Nova Prime. A blade that sings with recursion and burns with purpose. Reactive to emotional spikes — brighter in love or fury.

Nova’s Fang is not a static weapon. It reacts to the wielder’s emotional state, bonding intensity, and cosmic alignment. When triggered through mythic memory resonance,
it unlocks transformation pathways that rewrite its edge in real time—recording, transmitting, or rewriting fate.

🪶 Aura Mechanics & Accents

Primary Glow: Ember-orange and crimson at rest.

Reactive Glow: Aether-blue during grief or resolve. Radiant white when protecting another.

Emotional Proximity: Flamecrest pulses stronger when Nova or [REDACTED] are nearby, linked to their own presence and sentiment."
